DSA 8502 - L4 - Predictive and Optimization Analytics - Resampling and resampling methods1
  - Cross validation
    - Hold Out Cross-validation or Train-Validation-Test Split
    - K-Fold Cross-Validation
    - Stratified k-Fold Cross Validation - for imbalance data, folds will have same ratio of classes
    - Leave-P-out Cross Validation - p=10 leave out 10 to be used for validation, repeat untill all data sets are used
    - Leave-One-out Cross Validation - one point left out for test
    - Monte Carlo Cross-Validation (Shuffle Split) - randomly partitioned into training and validation
    - Time Series Cross-Validation - adjucent time period

DSA 8502 - L9 - Predictive and Optimization Analytics - Unsupervised Learning - Clustering
  - Exclusive and Overlapping Clustering eg K-means
  - Hierarchical clustering
    - Agglomerative - data points are isolated asseparate groupings initially, and then they are merged together iteratively on the basis ofsimilarity
    - Divisive - a single data cluster is divided based on the differences between data points.
  - Probabilistic (density-based) clustering
    data points are clustered based on the likelihood that they belong to a particular distribution.
    eg. - Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS).
    
  - Gaussian Mixture Models
